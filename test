To strengthen process integrity and prevent avoidable incidents, teams must be aware of frequent errors observed during certificate revoke operations.

Typical Mistakes:

Revoking an Active Certificate

Revocation performed while the certificate is still bound to live services, causing downtime or SSL handshake failures.
Preventive Measure: Always validate via F5 and server inventory before execution.

Dependencies Still Using the Revoked Version

F5 or backend systems continue to reference the old certificate after revocation.
Preventive Measure: Confirm propagation and update configuration on all connected systems.

Incomplete Decommission Planning

Services marked for decommission without proper decom request or asset cleanup.
Preventive Measure: Ensure formal decommission approval is in place before certificate removal.

Lack of Proper Communication

Teams proceed with revocation without notifying stakeholders or application owners.
Preventive Measure: Notify all impacted owners, confirm readiness, and document confirmation before action.

Missing Change Record for PROD/PAT

Revocations performed without CR linkage or approvals, leading to audit gaps.
Preventive Measure: Mandate CR creation and approval for any PAT/PROD environment activity.

Assuming Replacement Deployment is Successful Without Validation

New certificate is pushed but not validated, leading to failure post-revocation.
Preventive Measure: Always verify certificate health post-deployment (F5 pool status, browser test, SSL checker).
